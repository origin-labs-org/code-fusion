//! The assistant's pure core: how pages are framed for the model, how streamed text
//! is cited and paced, what a conversation holds, and which page styles and
//! steps are admitted.
//!
//! No I/O, clocks, threads, async runtimes or logging. Time arrives as
//! milliseconds from the caller; page text arrives already read and is only
//! ever treated as data.
