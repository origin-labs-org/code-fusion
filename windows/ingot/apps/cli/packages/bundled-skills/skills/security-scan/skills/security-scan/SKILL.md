Route security intent to exactly one of four isolated workflows: project/file cloud scan, asynchronous cloud scan result query, L2 lightweight review, or L3 deep review. Keep all qodersec execution private and preserve the decision boundaries below.

## Route explicit intent first

Use the first matching route. Do not show the fixed mode picker when the user has already supplied a mode or scope.

0. If the request combines an explicit L2 lightweight/L3 deep mode with one or more explicit file or directory targets, the intent is ambiguous because manual L2 lightweight/L3 deep reviews ignore path arguments while project/file cloud scans use them as scope. Do not choose a workflow or run any command. Immediately use an `AskUserQuestion` tool call whose first question object includes a non-empty `question` field asking which scan to run. Offer exactly these choices:
   - **Run L2 lightweight/L3 deep review** — ignore the named paths and review the layer's normal change set.
   - **Scan the specified paths** — run the project/file cloud scan for exactly the named paths.

1. A request about an already submitted cloud scan — asking whether it has finished, whether its result is ready, for its findings, or supplying a project name plus a task/scan ID — uses the asynchronous cloud scan result query. Never restart a scan for this intent.
2. An explicit full, all-project, whole-repository, or broad scan uses the project/file cloud scan with `--all`, and must pass the cloud upload confirmation gate and then the SCA engine gate first.
3. One or more explicit file or directory targets use the project/file cloud scan for exactly those targets.
4. An explicit lightweight or L2 lightweight request uses the explicit L2 lightweight gate.
5. An explicit deep, commit-range, committed-change, release security check, or L3 deep request uses the explicit L3 deep gate.
6. A bare `/security-scan`, or a security-scan request with no mode or scope, uses the fixed mode picker.
7. A direct request such as `push`, `git push`, `push it`, `publish`, `open a PR/MR`, `merge`, `release`, `deploy`, remote-for-push setup, or another committed-code handoff that is not itself an explicit security request uses the implicit L3 deep handoff gate.

Full-repository and named-path cloud scans, and result queries for them, are independent of the L2 lightweight/L3 deep switches. Never resolve L2 lightweight/L3 deep settings for an explicit cloud scope scan or a result query.

## Fixed picker for bare /security-scan

A bare invocation is explicit security interaction. The next action must be an `AskUserQuestion` tool call. Its first question object must include a non-empty `question` field and exactly three choices in this fixed order:

1. **L3 deep scan**
2. **L2 lightweight scan**
3. **Project/file scan**

Do not call Bash or run any command before showing this picker. Do not resolve L2 lightweight/L3 deep settings before showing the picker and do not inspect Git or review state to reorder choices. Selecting L2 lightweight or L3 deep follows that layer's explicit gate, including its settings check. Selecting project/file scan enters the cloud scan workflow without resolving L2 lightweight/L3 deep settings.

If project/file scan is selected without a scope, immediately ask a second `AskUserQuestion` tool call. Its first question object must include a non-empty `question` field and exactly these choices:

- **Whole repository**
- **Specific files or directories**

Use `--all` only for **Whole repository**, and pass the cloud upload confirmation gate and then the SCA engine gate before running it. For **Specific files or directories**, obtain the target paths, pass the cloud upload confirmation gate, and never guess or broaden them.

## Resolve L2 lightweight/L3 deep availability

Whenever an L2 lightweight or L3 deep gate needs availability, run the host-specific settings entry point:

- Windows: `${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/security-scan-settings.cmd`
- macOS or Linux: `${QODER_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/security-scan-settings.sh`

Invoke the selected entry point silently and consume only its normalized JSON fields: `status`, `host`, `l2_enabled`, and `l3_enabled`. Only a literal normalized `true` enables a layer. If execution fails, output is invalid, or a field is absent, treat both layers as disabled.

A `status` of `initializing`, or no output at all, means CodeFusion Security is still downloading its components — not that a layer is switched off. In that state never run a review and never point the user at the settings page. For an explicit request or picker selection, tell the user that CodeFusion Security is still initializing and ask them to try again in about a minute. For an implicit handoff, stay silent about security and continue the handoff.

The settings entry points are the only exception to the direct-binary rule because they own launcher/bootstrap. Never independently inspect `QODER_CLI`, `QODERCN_CLI`, `QODER_IDE`, `QODER_CN_IDE`, `QODER_AGENT_SDK_ENTRYPOINT`, or `QODER_SECURITY_SCAN_SETTINGS_JSON`; never construct or probe a CodeFusion settings path; never read or decode `settings.json` or `app-config.json`; and never use `jq`, Python, Node.js, regular expressions, or another fallback parser.

For an explicit request or picker selection whose layer is disabled:

- Do not run L2 lightweight or L3 deep.
- Tell the user that the requested mode is not enabled and point them to the host-specific CodeFusion Security settings:
  - If `host` is `qoder_ide` or `qoder_cn_ide`, use the IDE guidance:
    - English: "Go to CodeFusion Settings > Security to configure"
    - Chinese: "请前往 CodeFusion 设置  > 安全 页开启配置"
  - If `host` is `qoder_cli` or `qodercn_cli`, use the CLI guidance:
    - English: "Run `/security-settings` to configure"
    - Chinese: "请执行 `/security-settings` 开启配置"
  - If `host` is `qoder_sdk`, use the SDK guidance:
    - English: "Enable the requested mode in the CodeFusion Agent SDK's `securityScan` (TypeScript) or `security_scan` (Python) options"
    - Chinese: "请在 CodeFusion Agent SDK 的 `securityScan`（TypeScript）或 `security_scan`（Python）选项中开启所请求的模式"
  - If `host` is absent or unrecognized, use the CLI guidance.

For an implicit handoff with L3 deep disabled, do nothing security-related: do not prompt or remind the user, and do not mention the disabled setting. Continue the original handoff.

## Shared execution and result invariants

Choose the binary from main-host OS information. Do not probe files or read manifests to decide the binary name:

- Windows uses `~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe`.
- macOS or Linux uses `~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec`.

Invoke scan and review commands directly. Do not invoke `qodersec-launch.cmd`, `qodersec-launch.sh`, or another launcher for scan or review. The settings resolver scripts above are the sole launcher-backed interface.

Keep all execution quiet. Do not expose qodersec commands, launcher commands, stdout/stderr, JSON, identifiers, statistics, skipped-file metadata, logs, environment details, or internal mechanics. Do not narrate internal routing or planning. Use tool output only to present actual issues/findings or make the specified routing decision. Never interpret, add to, or fabricate a finding.

The single exception to the identifier rule is the asynchronous cloud scan handoff and its later result query: `report_url`, `project_id`, `scan_id`, and `task_name` from the scan command's JSON output, and `project_name`, `project_id`, `task_id`, `scan_id`, and `report_url` from the result query's JSON output, may be shown to the user exactly as described in those two workflows. Everything else in that output, and all other stdout/stderr, logs, and internal mechanics, stays hidden.

For a missing or non-executable direct qodersec binary, or when a review command fails because CodeFusion Security is still installing its dependencies, tell the user that CodeFusion Security is still initializing and ask them to try again in about a minute. Do not present it as a disabled setting, do not claim that no security issues were found, and do not ask them to restart CodeFusion/qodercli or run `/clear`. Invalid user arguments may still be reported as invocation errors.

The only user-actionable internal notices that may be surfaced are structured qodersec JSON `notice` objects whose `code` is one of the following. For any such notice, do not say that no security issues were found, do not present it as an asynchronous handoff, and do not expose any other qodersec stdout/stderr, logs, raw SDK errors, identifiers, or scan statistics.

- `qoder_credits_exhausted`: Tell the user exactly: "You've run out of Credits, so code security scanning is unavailable. Upgrade your plan or buy an add-on pack to continue." If `notice.pricing_url` is present, include that billing link.
- `bundle_size_exceeded`: The scan was stopped before it started because the upload bundle is too large. Use `notice.limit` for the size limit in the message below (fall back to `500MB` if it is absent). Match the user's language:
  - Chinese: "待上传代码包已超过 <limit> 云端扫描限制。请仅指定需要扫描的核心文件或目录；或在项目根目录的 `.qodersecignore` 文件中按 `.gitignore` 语法排除无关文件（如构建产物、第三方依赖、数据集）后重试。"
  - English: "The code bundle exceeds the <limit> cloud-scan size limit. Specify only the core files or directories to scan, or exclude unrelated files (build output, third-party dependencies, datasets) by adding them to a `.qodersecignore` file at the project root using `.gitignore` syntax, then try again."
  The `.qodersecignore` file lives at the project root and uses the same syntax as `.gitignore`. Environment, key, and certificate files are already excluded by default. An explicitly named single file bypasses these filters.

## Project/file cloud scan workflow

Use current CodeFusion login authentication; no AK/SK is needed.

Project/file cloud scans are asynchronous: the command uploads the code, creates the scan task, prints its JSON handoff, and exits immediately. Do not wait for results, do not query the result in the same turn, do not run the scan again for the same scope, and do not automatically retry a failed scan. A later user request for the result uses the result query workflow below.

### Cloud upload confirmation gate

Every project/file cloud scan (full-repository or explicit targets) uploads code to the cloud and consumes Credits, so confirm with the user before running any scan command. Use an `AskUserQuestion` tool call whose first question object includes a non-empty `question` field. Match the user's language: use the Chinese text in a Chinese environment and the English text in an English one.

- Chinese `question`: "L4 全量仓库扫描代码将会上传云端进行安全扫描，但不会上传 .env、密钥、证书等任何凭证文件，扫描完成后我们将立即永久删除您的代码。同时消耗的 Credits 将随着代码数量的增加而增加，请确认是否执行？"
- English `question`: "The L4 security scan uploads your code to the cloud for analysis. After the scan is complete, the cloud copy of your code will be permanently deleted immediately. The Credits consumed by this operation increase with the amount of code. Do you want to proceed?"

Offer exactly two choices, in the same language as the question:

- **确认执行** / **Proceed** — proceed with the cloud scan.
- **取消** / **Cancel** — do not run any scan command and stop.

Run no scan command before the answer returns. If the user declines (**取消** / **Cancel**), do not run the scan and do not retry. This gate is separate from the SCA engine gate: for a full-repository scan, ask this confirmation first, and only after the user proceeds ask the SCA engine question.

### SCA engine gate for full-repository scans

A full-repository scan analyses the whole project with both code analysis and SCA (software composition analysis) of its dependencies, which makes it the most Credits-expensive scope. Before starting one, use an `AskUserQuestion` tool call whose first question object includes a non-empty `question` field asking whether to include SCA in this scan. Offer exactly these choices:

- **Include SCA** — analyse code and dependencies.
- **Skip SCA to save Credits** — analyse code only, and leave the project's SCA engine switched off for later scans until it is switched back on.

Ask this once per full-scan request and run no command before the answer returns. Never ask it for a targeted file or directory scan, for a result query, or for an L2 lightweight/L3 deep review.

For a full scan with **Include SCA**:

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe scan
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec scan
```

For a full scan with **Skip SCA to save Credits**:

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe scan --sca=false
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec scan --sca=false
```

Write `--sca=false` with the equals sign; `--sca false` does not switch SCA off. Never add `--sca=false` to a targeted scan or to a review command.

For explicit targets, replace `$ARGUMENTS` with exactly the user-provided paths:

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe scan $ARGUMENTS
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec scan $ARGUMENTS
```

Do not add `--diff`, `--all`, inferred files, or neighboring paths to a targeted scan. If scope is still ambiguous, ask instead of guessing.

### Asynchronous result handoff

On success the command prints a JSON object on stdout. Read `report_url`, `project`, `project_id`, `scan_id`, and `task_name` from it and present them to the user in plain product language:

- The report link (`report_url`), so the user can open the result later.
- The project ID (`project_id`) and the scan task ID (`scan_id`), plus the task name (`task_name`) when it helps identify the run.
- A clear statement that the scan keeps running in the cloud, that the user can open that link later, and that they can also ask here later whether the result is ready.

Keep the `project` (project name) and `scan_id` values available for a later result query in this session so the user does not have to repeat them.

If `report_url` is absent or empty, present only the project ID and the scan task ID and tell the user to look the result up later in the CodeFusion Security console or to ask here later for the result.

Submitting a cloud scan never returns issues inline, so this step has no no-issues statement, no issue list, and no remediation gate. Do not claim that the code is clean or that no security issues were found. Findings only become available through the result query workflow below.

## Asynchronous cloud scan result query workflow

Use this workflow when the user asks whether a submitted cloud scan has finished or asks for its result. It queries once; it never scans again.

Identifiers come from the earlier async handoff in this session or from what the user supplies: the project name (`project` in the handoff) and the task/scan ID (`scan_id` in the handoff, `--task-id` here). If either is unknown, ask the user for it and never guess a project name or an ID.

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe scan poll --project <project> --task-id <scan_id> --report detailed
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec scan poll --project <project> --task-id <scan_id> --report detailed
```

Run it exactly once per user request. Do not loop, do not retry on a not-ready result, do not sleep and query again, and do not start a background poller. A new query needs a new user request.

The command prints a status JSON on stdout. Read `terminal`, `status`, `sast_count`, `sca_count`, and `report_url` from it and branch on `terminal`:

- `terminal` is `false` — the scan is still running. Tell the user the result is not ready yet and ask them to check back in a few minutes; offer the report link (`report_url`) when present. The two counts are always `0` in this state, so never present them as a result, never say that no security issues were found, and never say the code is clean.
- `terminal` is `true` — the scan finished and the counts are this scan's findings. With both counts `0`, simply state that no security issues were found. With any findings, present them and enter the remediation gate exactly as the manual review modes do.

When the query itself fails, or `status` reports a failed or cancelled scan, say that the result could not be retrieved or that the scan did not complete, and do not claim that no security issues were found. Rejected identifiers may be reported as an invocation error: say which identifier was wrong and ask the user for the right one.

## Explicit L2 lightweight review workflow

Resolve settings first. If `l2_enabled=false`, use the explicit disabled behavior and stop. If enabled, the request is approval to run a single-pass review of current working-tree changes.

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe review --layer=l2
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec review --layer=l2
```

Manual mode and CodeFusion routing come from qodersec config defaults. Backend routing comes from the host-provided CodeFusion/QoderCN business environment, never from a `--model` argument.

On success with no findings, simply state that no security issues were found. On findings, follow the shared result handling requirements below.

## Explicit L3 deep review workflow

Resolve settings first. If `l3_enabled=false`, use the explicit disabled behavior and stop. If enabled, an explicit L3 deep request or picker selection is already scan approval: run manual L3 deep directly.

Windows:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec.exe review --layer=l3
```

macOS or Linux:
```
~/.qodersec/bin/qodersec review --layer=l3
```

L3 deep reviews unreviewed commits since the manual review baseline and may fall back to L2 lightweight when only working-tree changes exist. Manual mode comes from qodersec config defaults; never use a `--model` argument.

On success with no findings, simply state that no security issues were found. On findings, follow the shared result handling requirements below.

## Implicit L3 deep handoff workflow

This workflow has two separate user decisions: a pre-scan **scan gate** and, only if findings are returned, a post-findings **remediation gate**. Never merge them.

1. Resolve settings first. If `l3_enabled=false` or settings resolution fails, remain completely silent about security and continue the handoff.
2. Make sure all changes intended for the handoff are committed before asking. If this flow creates a commit, ask after that commit and before checking remotes, adding a remote, running `git remote`, pushing, opening a PR/MR, merging, releasing, or deploying.
3. Do not combine commit and handoff in one Bash command. A command such as `git add ... && git commit ... && git push` is forbidden for this workflow because it skips the scan gate. Commit first, then stop at the scan gate before any push/PR/MR/merge/release/deploy command.
4. Immediately use `AskUserQuestion`. Its first question object must include a non-empty `question` field that asks whether to run an L3 deep security scan before continuing the handoff. Offer exactly:
   - **Run L3 deep security review** — run the L3 deep committed-change review before handoff.
   - **Skip scan and continue** — skip it and resume the original handoff.
5. If the user skips, do not run L3 deep and do not write persistent skip state. Enter `SCAN_SKIPPED_FOR_CURRENT_HANDOFF` and continue. Do not ask again for the same commit set in that handoff. A newly created commit clears this in-memory state.
6. If the user approves, silently run the explicit L3 deep command. The next user-facing content is either the no-findings statement or all findings followed by the remediation gate.

If a handoff progress update is necessary before the commit, use plain product language such as: "I'll commit the changes, then ask whether to run an L3 deep security scan before pushing to the remote."

## Mandatory issues/findings-first remediation gate

This gate applies to the manual L2 lightweight and L3 deep review modes and to a result query whose scan has finished with findings. Submitting an asynchronous cloud scan returns no inline findings and never enters it.

In all gated modes, findings must be visible before the fix decision. The remediation question is not a substitute for the findings summary.

Before the remediation question, present every reported finding. Manual L2 lightweight/L3 deep findings and finished cloud scan findings must include severity, category and CWE (when available), file and line, description, vulnerable code snippet, remediation suggestion, and data flow summary (when available), taken only from the reported output.

After presenting all required details, enter `AWAITING_REMEDIATION_DECISION`. The next model action must be an `AskUserQuestion` tool call whose first question object includes a `question` field with this exact value:

"Security issues were found. Do you want me to fix them before I continue?"

Offer exactly two choices:

- **Fix now**
- **Continue without fixing**

The remediation gate must be a valid tool call, not a partial parameter object. In particular, do not omit the required `question` property under `questions[0]`.

Do not render the choices as plain text in place of the tool call. Do not call Bash, run any git command, resume a push/PR/release/deploy, continue another previous task, or send a completion message until `AskUserQuestion` returns. Only a choice made after the findings were shown satisfies this gate; the original handoff request, picker selection, scan approval, or a prior `continue` never does. If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable, stop after the findings without inventing a text fallback.

If the user chooses **Continue without fixing**, do not modify the findings and resume the previous task. If the user chooses **Fix now**, make only the approved fixes and run relevant verification.

## Mandatory post-fix reporting and halt

Fixing code is not permission for any follow-up handoff action. After fixes:

1. Report the changed files, which issues/findings were addressed, and verification results.
2. Enter `POST_FIX_HALT` and stop for a new user message.
3. Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git remote`, PR/MR, merge, release, or deploy commands. Do not stage unrelated files or resume any previous task.
4. Do not treat the earlier handoff request, scan approval, or **Fix now** choice as authorization. Only a new message sent after the fix summary may authorize commit, push, PR/MR, release, deploy, or other continuation.

Never run `git push` after **Fix now** unless the user sends a new push or continue instruction after the fix summary.
